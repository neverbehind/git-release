# git release

Create release candidate branches with ease! `:)`

Under the hood `git release` uses the git config system to store lists of branches, and creates release files that store the branch list for you.


*Install:*
* Checkout Repo
* `cp /path/to/repo/git-release /local/path/dir/` (Copy the git-release executable to a PATH dir, so you can use it globally) 
 * OSX - copy to `~/bin` which automatically adds to PATH, open a new terminal window.

*Quick Start:*

> Most Common Process: Initialize release, add features, then create a the release by merging all branches in.

* `cd /to/repo`
* `git release init v0.0.0 0`
* `git release feature [partial branch name]`
* `git release roll`


*List of Commands:*
- `git release init [version] [candidate]` to configure release versions
- `git release add [full remote branch path]` to add feature branches into the list to release
- `git release feature [branch search string]` to search for and add feature branches into the list to release
- `git release deploystatus` to output the status of the release and the branches and the respective commit hash for each
- `git release remove [full remote branch path]` to remove feature branches from the list
- `git release status` to see what version you are on and the branches added
- `git release roll` to roll out a new release candidate branch, which:
 - Creates a new branch based on release versioning, incrementing the RC
 - Commits the Branch list to the new branch
 - Merges in each of the added feature branches
- `git release append` similar to roll, but doesn't create a new release branch, simple remerges all branches into the current RC
- `git release next` similar to roll, but uses current release branch as the base branch, instead of master
- `git release deploy` checkout master, and merge in release branch and tag commit with release tag.
- `git release dump` deletes release branch and rollsback the candidate version.
- `git release checkout` displays a list of release branches, allows for switching from release to release
- `git release devbranches` to list out branches that are contained in the development branch, that are not yet on master
- `git release checkoutfeature` to find and create local branch from remote feature branch
